"""Inspect, validate and read user-uploaded GeoTIFFs for custom exposomes.

Two jobs, both pure functions over rasterio:

  * at upload — say whether the file can be a C3 template at all (has a CRS, is
    north-up with no rotation, lies over the continental US), and describe it
    for the mapping UI;
  * at run time — turn the C3 weights' ``grid_id`` list back into pixel values,
    so the C4 step can read a plain ``(grid_id, value[, year])`` table through
    ``read_table`` with no plugin, exactly as a polygon dataset does.

The ``grid_id`` convention is the pipeline's: 0-based, row-major,
``grid_id = row * width + col`` (``grid_weights`` with ``grid_id_offset: 0``).
The noise reader inverts it the same way.
